Known Bugs
==========


Next Thing
==========
* "finish" properties for the geometries
* need test for approximateWithin
* start theorem library
* replace provably unreachable errors with irrefutable patterns
* in CartesianPlane model, use orientation matrix for areCollinear
* should interpolate/interpolateH be a class? ("RealPath" or some such)
* models should not export constructors (use coordsMaybe instead?)
* tests for Curve instances
* should theorems be in test modules?


Soonish
=======
* page size in view options
* SemiCircle equation type
* Curve instances for SemiCircle, Ray


Eventually
==========
* model ellipses, hyperbolas in Algebra.Equation (needed for disc models)
* implement klein disc model of elliptic geometry
* implement euclidean disc model
* beltrami disc model of hyperbolic geometry
* alternative output formats: SVG, TikZ, animate with GLOSS
* setopacity :: Fig a -> Fig a (alter all draw commands?)
* elliptic geometry? (will need alternate class hierarchy)
* origami?
* major arc equation type
* elliptic arcs (?)


Ongoing
=======
* Implement theorems; include in test suite
* illustrate theorems; include in demo
* beef up test suite for Algebra library (need to test equations)


Maybe Someday
=============
* interactive graphical output (?)
* make CartesianPlane & PoincarePlane types more general (e.g. CartesianPlane t)
* option to view "scaffolding" in e.g. poincare disc
